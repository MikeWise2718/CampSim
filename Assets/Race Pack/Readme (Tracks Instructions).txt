Instructions for Race Circuit creation:

- It's advisable you start your creation with "Track1" or "Track2" prefabs.

- All track pivots are positioned on the bottom of model, you have to connect ALL TRACKS 
  with the same pivot direction. "Instructions1.jpg" image is a visual reference of a 
  correct track construction.

- "DiagonalTracks" and "DiagonalCurveTracks" looks like "Tracks" and "CurveTracks" 
  prefabs, BUT they're not the same. You MUST USE Diagonals ONLY when previously use 
  "DiagonalTrackStart" until you use "DiagonalTrackEnd", then you can use "Tracks" 
  and "CurveTracks" again. 
  IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THIS STEPS, your creation Start and Finish NEVER close in the 
  same position. "Instructions2.jpg" image is a visual reference of a correct track 
  construction.
